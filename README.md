# Azure Red Hat Openshift for Canadian Public Sector Customers

The intention of this project is to capture a standardized or optimized configuration for Azure Red Hat Openshift (ARO),
especially for customers operating in a restricted environment such as for Protected B, Medium Integrity, Medium Availability (PBMM).

This project uses the [Azure Landing Zones for Canadian Public Sector](https://github.com/Azure/CanadaPubSecALZ) as the starting configuration, and will eventually be included there as a landing zone archetype.

## Documentation

The configuration of the solution is described [here](./Docs/README.md), with more assets to come.
